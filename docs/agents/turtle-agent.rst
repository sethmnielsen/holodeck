Description
-----------
A simple turtle-bot agent. The turtle agent moves when forces are applied 
to it - so it has momentum and mass, compared to the :ref:`sphere-agent` 
which teleports around.

See :class:`~holodeck.agents.TurtleAgent` for more details.

Sockets
-------

- ``CameraSocket`` located at the front of the body
- ``Viewport`` located behind the agent
