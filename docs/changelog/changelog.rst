Holodeck 0.3.0
--------------
*11/02/2019*

This is a content release focused on improving the :ref:`android-agent` and
adding more scenarios and tasks for it. We also added a new floating hand
agent to provide a simpler agent that can do many of the dexterity tasks.

Highlights
~~~~~~~~~~
- Added :ref:`dexterity-package` with new worlds and scenarios (see below for 
  comprehensive listing)
- Added :ref:`clean-up-task` and :ref:`cup-game-task` tasks
- Added :ref:`hand-agent`

- Added the :ref:`hand-agent` - a simplified Android hand that can float 
  around
  (`#287 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/287>`_)

  - HandAgent can be used with the same Android-specific sensors (
    :class:`~holodeck.sensors.JointRotationSensor`,
    :class:`~holodeck.sensors.PressureSensor`,
    :class:`~holodeck.sensors.RelativeSkeletalPositionSensor`)

- Added new tasks sensors for specific worlds

  - :ref:`cup-game-task`
    (`#318 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/pull/318>`_)

  - :ref:`clean-up-task`
    (`#321 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/pull/321>`_)

- Packages can be installed directly from a URL
  (see :class:`~holodeck.packagemanager.install`)
  (`#129 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/129>`_)
- Agent sensors can now be rotated at run time with
  :meth:`~holodeck.sensors.HolodeckSensor.rotate`.
  (`#305 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/305>`_)
- The config files can now specify whether an agent should be spawned
  (`#303 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/pull/303>`_)
- Pressing ``h`` now shows the coordinates of the agent the viewport is
  following or the coordinates of the camera if it is detached (see
  :ref:`hotkeys`).
  (`#253 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/253>`_)
- The viewport now follows the main agent as specified in the
  config file by default.
  (`#238 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/238>`_)
- You can now specify the number of ticks you want to occur in the 
  :meth:`~holodeck.environments.HolodeckEnvironment.tick` and the 
  :meth:`~holodeck.environments.HolodeckEnvironment.step` methods,
  (`#313 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/pull/313>`_)

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Increased the :ref:`android-agent`'s strength in the
  ``ANDROID_MAX_SCALED_TORQUES`` control scheme.

  - Previously the AndroidAgent didn't have enough strength to even move its
    legs.
  - Strength was approximately doubled (See
    `JointMaxTorqueControlScheme.h <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck-engine/blob/develop/Source/Holodeck/Agents/Public/JointMaxTorqueControlScheme.h#L50>`_
    )
- Location sensor now returns the location of the sensor, not just the agent
  (`#306 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/306>`_)
- Updated to Unreal Engine 4.22
  (`#241 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/241>`_)
- :ref:`turtle-agent` is now subject to gravity, has increased power,
  is black, and slightly smaller.
  (`#217 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/217>`_)
- Removed the ``set_state()`` and ``teleport()`` methods from the
  :class:`~holodeck.environments.HolodeckEnvironment` class. 
  
  These methods were duplicates of the corresponding methods on the
  :class:`~holodeck.agents.HolodeckAgent` class. See the linked issue for 
  migration suggestions ðŸ‘‰
  (`#311 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/311>`_)
- Removed the ``get/set_ticks_per_capture`` methods from the 
  :class:`~holodeck.agents.HolodeckAgent` and 
  :class:`~holodeck.environments.HolodeckEnvironment` classes, moved
  :meth:`~holodeck.sensors.RGBCamera.set_ticks_per_capture` method to the
  :class:`~holodeck.sensors.RGBCamera` class. 
  (`#197 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/197>`_)
- Viewport will now follow the main agent by default.
  (`#238 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/238>`_)
- Viewport will not be rendered when it is hidden (``show_viewport`` param in 
  :class:`~holodeck.environments.HolodeckEnvironment`, Linux only)
  (`#283 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/283>`_)

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed the :class:`~holodeck.sensors.RelativeSkeletalPositionSensor`.

  - This sensor returns the location of bones, not sensors. Since there are
    more bones than joints, previously it returned them in a completely
    different order than expected.
  - Now the order for this sensor is explicitly specified in
    :ref:`android-bones` and :ref:`hand-bones`.
  - Previously on the first tick it would return uninitialized garbage on the
    first tick
- Fixed being unable to spawn the :ref:`turtle-agent`.
  (`#308 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/308>`_)
- Fixed the :meth:`~holodeck.agents.HolodeckAgent.set_physics_state` method.
  (`#311 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/311>`_)
- Fixed agent spawn rotations being in the incorrect order. Fixed the
  documentation that specified the incorrect order as well (:ref:`rotations`)
  (`#309 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/309>`_)
- Fixed being unable to set the ticks per capture of a camera if it was not
  named ``RGBCamera``.
  (`#197 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/197>`_)
- Fixed being unable to make a Holodeck window larger than the current screen
  resolution 
  (`#301 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/301>`_)
- Fixed being unable to configure :class:`~holodeck.sensors.ViewportCapture`
  sensor.
  (`#301 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/301>`_)
