Holodeck 0.2.2dev
--------------
*Release Date TBD*

Features! Features! Features! üçï

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added the :ref:`hand-agent` - a simplified Android hand that can float 
  around
  (`#287 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/287>`_)

  - HandAgent can be used with the same Android-specific sensors (
    :class:`~holodeck.sensors.JointRotationSensor`,
    :class:`~holodeck.sensors.PressureSensor`,
    :class:`~holodeck.sensors.RelativeSkeletalPositionSensor`)
- Packages can be installed directly from a URL
  (see :class:`~holodeck.packagemanager.install`)
  (`#129 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/129>`_)
- Agent sensors can now be rotated at run time
  (`#305 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/305>`_)
- The config files can now specify whether an agent should be spawned
  (`#303 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/pull/303>`_)
- Pressing ``h`` now shows the coordinates of the agent the viewport is
  following or the coordinates of the camera if it is detached (see
  :ref:`hotkeys`).
  (`#253 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/253>`_)
- You can now specify the number of ticks you want to occur in the 
  :meth:`~holodeck.environments.HolodeckEnvironment.tick` and the 
  :meth:`~holodeck.environments.HolodeckEnvironment.step` methods,
  (`#313 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/pull/313>`_)

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Increased the :ref:`android-agent`'s strength in the
  ``ANDROID_MAX_SCALED_TORQUES`` control scheme.

  - Previously the AndroidAgent didn't have enough strength to even move its
    legs.
  - Strength was approximately doubled (See
    `JointMaxTorqueControlScheme.h <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck-engine/blob/develop/Source/Holodeck/Agents/Public/JointMaxTorqueControlScheme.h#L50>`_
    )
- Location sensor now returns the location of the sensor, not just the agent
  (`#306 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/306>`_)
- Updated to Unreal Engine 4.22
  (`#241 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/241>`_)
- :ref:`turtle-agent` is now subject to gravity, has increased power,
  is black, and slightly smaller.
  (`#217 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/217>`_)
- Removed the ``set_state()`` and ``teleport()`` methods from the
  :class:`~holodeck.environments.HolodeckEnvironment` class. 
  
  These methods were duplicates of the corresponding methods on the
  :class:`~holodeck.agents.HolodeckAgent` class. See the linked issue for 
  migration suggestions üëâ
  (`#311 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/311>`_)

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed the :class:`~holodeck.sensors.RelativeSkeletalPositionSensor`.

  - This sensor returns the location of bones, not sensors. Since there are
    more bones than joints, previously it returned them in a completely
    different order than expected.
  - Now the order for this sensor is explicitly specified in
    :ref:`android-bones` and :ref:`hand-bones`.
  - Previously on the first tick it would return uninitialized garbage on the
    first tick
- Fixed being unable to spawn the :ref:`turtle-agent`.
  (`#308 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/308>`_)
- Fixed the :meth:`~holodeck.agents.HolodeckAgent.set_physics_state` method.
  (`#311 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/311>`_)
- Fixed agent spawn rotations being in the incorrect order. Fixed the
  documentation that specified the incorrect order as well (:ref:`rotations`)
  (`#309 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/309>`_)
  

Holodeck 0.2.2
--------------
*06/20/2019*

This is mostly a maintenance release focused on cleaning up bugs that were
unresolved in ``0.2.1``


New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- When freecamming around, :ref:`pressing shift <hotkeys>` moves the
  camera faster.
  (`#99 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/99>`_)
- Agents can have a rotation specified in the scenario config files
  (`#209 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/209>`_)
- Custom scenarios can be made with dictionaries as well as ``json`` files.
  See :ref:`custom-scenarios`
  (`#275 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/275>`_)
- Documented how to improve Holodeck performance.
  See :ref:`improving-performance`
  (`#109 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/109>`_)


Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed :meth:`~holodeck.environments.HolodeckEnvironment.info` method
  (`#182 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/182>`_)

  :meth:`~holodeck.environments.HolodeckEnvironment.reset`.
  (`#254 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/254>`_)
- Fixed rain not being very visible on Linux
  (`#235 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/235>`_)
- Fixed teleport command not working on the Android

- Fixed RGBCamera intermittently returning a matrix of zeros after resetting
  (`#271 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/271>`_)
- Fixed ``EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION`` on Windows after creating an environment
  (`#270 <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/issues/270>`_)
- Fixed :ref:`MazeWorld-FinishMazeSphere` task not going terminal when task
  was finished.

  - Added a post with a golden ball on top to the end of the maze,
    this is now the tasks's target

Holodeck 0.2.1
