CleanUp-TableHand
=================

**Type:** :ref:`clean-up-task`

This scenario gives a hand agent a reward based on the number of pieces of
trash it pushes from a table to the adjacent the trash can. This is intended
to be an easier version of other cleanup tasks, since the agent does not have
to pick up the trash, it can simply slide it off the table.

Agents
