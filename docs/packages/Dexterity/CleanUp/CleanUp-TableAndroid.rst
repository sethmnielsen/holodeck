CleanUp-TableAndroid
=====================

**Type:** :ref:`clean-up-task`

This scenario gives an android a reward based on the number of pieces of trash
it pushes from a table to the adjacent the trash can. This is intended to be 
an easier version of other cleanup tasks, since the agent does not have to
pick up the trash, it can simply slide it off the table.

Agents

- ``android0``: Main :ref:`Android <android-agent>` agent
